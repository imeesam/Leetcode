    "This one’s called the **Boyer–Moore Voting Algorithm**, and the version you shared is a **generalized** form (for finding up to *k* majority elements). Let’s go step-by-step in super simple terms 👇\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What are we trying to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find elements that appear **a lot** — not necessarily the single most frequent, but those that appear *more than n / (k + 1) times* in a list of length n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If k = 1 → find the element that appears more than half the time (the classic majority).\n",
    "If k = 2 → find elements appearing more than one-third of the time.\n",
    "and so on.\n",

    "### 🧩 Step 1: The “voting” phase (finding candidates)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you’re watching numbers walk past one by one, and you only have **k slots** to keep track of “leaders.”\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have a **vote counter** for each leader.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when a new number shows up:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **If it’s already a leader** → give it one more vote.\n",
    "2. **If it’s not a leader and there’s an empty slot** → make it a new leader with one vote.\n",
    "3. **If it’s not a leader and all k slots are full** →\n",
    "   you *subtract one vote from every current leader.*\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If any leader’s votes drop to zero → kick them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "💭 What this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When an element shows up frequently, it keeps its votes high and *survives* the rounds.\n",
    "* Rare or mixed-up elements cancel each other out — they lose votes and eventually get kicked out.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, after scanning through the list once, the “leaders” that remain are **potential majority candidates** — but we don’t yet know if they *really* appear a lot. They’ve just survived the elimination process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Step 2: The “verification” phase\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we take those surviving candidates and **count how many times they actually appear** in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "This second check is needed because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some candidates might have survived just because others canceled each other out, not because they truly dominate the list.\n",
